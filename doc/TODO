Monte Carlo experiments:

* compute, and then plot upper limit on Γ vs R_p

* write up a bit less flippantly

* figure out how much stellar properties matter. Your conclusions should be
robust against quite large shifts in the population.

* sample over some reasonable stellar radius distribution
* sample Rp radii from family of Kepler planets. (like, 12 delta functions)
* sample mutual inclinations δi from a Rayleigh distribution. (e.g., the posteriors of Li+ 2016)
for dilution D, also sample it. from:
* RoboAO papers: Nick Law.
* contact binary literature papers. (e.g., starting at Tokovinin's mass
  ratios). Look for luminosity ratios.

* try CKS:
  * if you assume all the light is from the primary star (crappy assumption),
    you, 
  -> use NASA exoplanet archive to cross-correlate those masses and radii with
    colors. Usual colors you care about: B-V, g-i


RERUN PRODUCTION-LEVEL RECOV:
* verify output looks OK

* should be able to identify KIC 2856960 events (Armstrong 2012's disc). (or at
  least know why they're not showing up)

* which stars have known planet candidates already in our catalog (e.g., KIC
11013201 has real dips, and is also KOI 972. Possible delta Scuti 
oscillations, with the transiting planet. ?!?!. What does that mean about
evolutionary state?)

* manually parse all SNR>3 candidates. get someone else (Fei? JNW?) to weigh
in.

* review "maybes" too (from ur injections, these could be real)

PAPER

* for the one candidate you'll show the in-transit displacement for, turn
row/col into RA/dec so that your plot can have RA/dec, and so that you can put
the star position down

* in injrecovresult_analysis, summarize_realsearch_result you want to be
including the top 5 BLS peaks for your cuts. matters for completeness!
(~40% vs ~50%)

CANDIDATE SEARCH: 

* 12055014 -- plausible candidate (missed so far). There's obvious by-eye
periodic dips

#OPTIONAL TODO#

(aka: it would be surprising if this stuff happened)

* run thru whitening a few times w/ different parameters, to generate the CDF
  comparison plot. this should be cheap vs injrecov or even just recov, and will
  be useful to compare different whitening choices (and to justify the
  arbitrary search parameters ur currently using)

* be sure the two duplicates, 3832716 and 8167938, have both their periods
  treated (... or at least, be able to justify why they shouldnt)
