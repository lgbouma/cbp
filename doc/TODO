* Email Andrej: how contaminated with gamma dor are these?

  11013201:
  (Almost certain) the KEBC period is wrong. The period they give is a
  pulsation period (cf. Uytterhoeven+ (2011) and Niemczura+ (2015)). It should be a single 

  7515679:
  What do "Pu" flag mean? Not described in Kirk+ (2013). 


  > have examples to back up claim that they're contaminated.
  > e.g. crossmatch the 2011 Kepler astroseis paper
  Should Gamma dor be more incoherent? 

* how do you determine W vs A type contact binaries? can it be done through
the LC alone? (important for estimating contamination fraction within things
hand-labelled as overcontact EBs)

-> how do you rule these out?

* Look at CFOP. Get account, query KOI, discussion.

FURTHER SCRUTINY OF CANDIDATES:
(The goal being: we _want_ to rule these things out. Can we do it?)
* Literature
* CFOP
* Exoplanet archive
* Contamination fraction
* Centroid motion: specific to dips.
  -> Look at vector difference associated w/ moments in time (in dips and
    outside). N.b. centroid time
  Read: Steve Bryson.
* Better detrending / masking (cleanest possible look at signal). Careful f(t)
  timeseries.
* **Odd/even** (key!)

--> half or a third survive. Then we get spectra.
* Timing analysis of the dips: do we get nonperiodicites? -> does it hold w/ planet hypothesis?
Transit shape check: tricky b/c we don't expect it to be normal shaped. But if
  its excessively V-shaped.

Photometric followup possible.
High angular resoln of events -> another way of verifying it's from the star itself.

CANDIDATE SEARCH
* deep-dive into the literature for every candidate on your
list. Also, produce more narrow diagnostics (e.g., trimming out weird jumps,
dropping bad quarters, etc). Do they get better? Worse? What is known?

* review "maybes" too

```
** Contamination factors from KIC indicate risk of light contamination from
neighboring stars

Uytterhoeven et al (2011):
** Table 3 & Table 4: KIC ID and classifications (for γ Dor vs δ Sct vs
hybrid). 
** Table 1 has ~750 candidate γ Dor and δ Sct pulsators.

Armstrong+ (2013): Best game in town(?) for KEBC temperatures.
* Compare performance w/ known systems (e.g. vs Armstrong+ 2013's Table 5)

Why do we care about the stellar properties?
1. We need to estimate our contamination fraction in the ~1k K"EB"C sample
2. If we want to convert our search result into Γ_V vs κ, we need to know the
inclinations of the systems, and the stellar radii (assuming Γ_V is defined
over planet radius, not δ).

The KEBC produced rough values of sini, R2/R1, T2/T1, which they then
retracted. Armstrong produced rough Teffs.
```

PRODUCTION-LEVEL REAL SEARCH
* If Q0 RMS >> rest of quarters, just throw out Q0 when searching for dips.
  (Otherwise the super-noisy bit dominates the search results).
  See: 11447953, 6471048
* rerun, given the new BLS search params (not much should change >_>)
* bribe another human labeller to spend ~2-3 boring hrs looking at dips.



PRODUCTION-LEVEL INJ/RECOV:
* in find_dips, check if Q0 exists, and if its RMS is much higher than
everything else. If so, throw it out. (b/c this means that substraction failed)

* Following DFM peerless, p. 15: "the transit signal is computed and MULTIPLIED
into the PDC LC"

* store whatever stellar parameters you will need (e.g. peerless eqs 4-6. Need
stellar parameters, with better estimates than just asserting Rstar=1.5Rsun,
duty cycle estimate from time groups, eccentricity of orbit, etc. )

    #FIXME: improve write_search_result to write the correct parameters

* to understand those parameters, consider the eventual inference you will be
making. it will be an (upper bound on an) occurrence rate over a volume, Γ_V vs
κ, a Fischer distribution parameter (since these two things are very
degenerate). 

* make sure SNR>3 cut makes it in.

* make sure exactly the same post-find_dips work is being on the injected LCs

----------

* Make sure injrecov works with the recov-only update (i.e. test it & break it)

* in find_dips, check if Q0 exists, and if its RMS is much higher than
everything else. If so, throw it out. (b/c this means that substraction failed)

* Following DFM peerless, p. 15: "the transit signal is computed and MULTIPLIED
into the PDC LC"

* push injections (& search) out to longer periods(?).
(E.g., apply something like DFM's single transit search algorithm/inspired by
it)

* debug completeness map weirdness:
completeness_heatmap_top1_pfSNR_vs_periodcbp is not showing boxes in the
right place, if you compare with the scatter plot (e.g., should be more low
period, higher pf-SNR objects).

* production run on actual KEBC stars, now that completeness is high enough,
and everything works fast enough.  ->  _look through_ the ~1.5k search results,
sorted per the above.
(my toy run of ~500 LCs on the desktop is not sustainable)

* read Mowlavi et al recent Gaia EB gaussian fitting discussion. Could apply to
HAT data. What did they learn?  http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10597
(also, read his other papers)

* how big & how fine of an injection grid do we need/want to answer the
_statistical_ questions (on occurrence rates) --> see
../../peerless/peerless/occurrence.py for an example of the actual calculation
that's required

> yes, it must be a big grid.

* make to account for SNR_rec_pf > 3 and multiple of P_rec_by_P_EB cuts in
evaluating completenss.  It shouldn't change things.



PAPER

* copy template from e.g. DFM (duh)
* write introduction


----------

* read Mowlavi et al recent Gaia EB gaussian fitting discussion. Could apply to
HAT data. What did they learn?  http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10597
(also, read his other papers)

* why does that one KOI show up as a δ scuti? (was this a failure in the KEBC
pipeline?). How many of these instances are there?

* read WASP 33 Van Esse+ COROT paper. δ scuti w/ a transiting planet.  >
spatially-resolved light from transiting planet. Can you get e.g., obliquity of
star? (if you understand the pulsation dirns, you get a preferred dirn). Can u
understand the pulsations better by getting spatially- resolved light?

* look at DFM's new O(N) GP models. Can they be used for *discovery*, as is the
idea here?

[total aside question]:
* What aspects of stellar formation (or post-formation physical evolution) can
be inferred from contact EBs? Do they trace any particular physical processes?

* Rucinski 2004: how do you confirm that a variable star is a contact EB, not a
delta scuti or gamma doradus? 

?? Why should a M_V(logP) calibration EXIST / work? 
Discussed in any of: Rucisnki 1994, Rucisnki & Duerbeck 1997, Rucinski 2004

Possible improvements:

* which stars have known planet candidates already in our catalog (e.g., KIC
  11013201 has real dips, and is also KOI 972. Possible delta Scuti 
  oscillations, with the transiting planet. ?!?!. What does that mean about
  evolutionary state?)

* avoid fitting out subharmonics of planet transits!!
Example cases: 8122124. See 8122124_qnum9_inum2_sap.png
Possibilities: 
- model comparison?
- smart condition on really only searching for harmonics & subharmonics 
  of EB signal (i.e. look over some frequency comb)
- nb. this really should only be an issue w/ the shortest-period injected 
  planets

* review doc/discussion from 170308. consider integrating QATS (if we want 
  long-period, ED rather than just EC and EA sensitivity)

* Understand how DFM+ peerless implemented model comparison once you have nice
    transits. Implement it.

----------

* How to fit out spots: e.g., with `george` (GP regression)?

Longer-term ideas:
*Detrend+normalize:
    Match the KEBC detrending? As-is, I think I'm leaving in trends that are
    too big.
*Period finder:
    Assess for what fraction we need to revert to KEBC period.

astrokep.find_lightcurve_gaps

* add "s2n_on_grass" (Petigura et al 2013) to cull out "significant" transits
-> can do this in post-processing, or (likely better) add direct to
astrobase. See FIXME below.

astrokep.stitch_lightcurve_gaps

astrokep.keplerflux_to_keplermag

 PyKE is also worth assessing: what detrending tricks does it use?
