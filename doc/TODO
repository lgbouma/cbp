PRODUCTION-LEVEL RECOV:

* make sure prob(det) > 0 cut makes it in. (or whatever analog based on injrecov
parameter space that works). (do it just as a hard cut in SNR, to keep it simple)

* dipsearchplots:
    * add Tdur estimate in text
    * fix BLS line to be rectangular, not triangular

* should be able to identify KIC 2856960 events (Armstrong 2012's disc). (or at
  least know why they're not showing up)

* which stars have known planet candidates already in our catalog (e.g., KIC
11013201 has real dips, and is also KOI 972. Possible delta Scuti 
oscillations, with the transiting planet. ?!?!. What does that mean about
evolutionary state?)

* rerun production-level recov

* relook at all SNR>3 

CANDIDATE SEARCH: 
* review "maybes" too

* make to account for SNR_rec_pf > 3 and multiple of P_rec_by_P_EB cuts in
evaluating completenss.  It shouldn't change things.

*Period finder:
  Assess for what fraction we need to revert to KEBC period. Include in
  description.

* 12055014 -- plausible candidate (missed so far). There's obvious by-eye
periodic dips

(aka: it would be surprising if this stuff happened)

* run thru whitening a few times w/ different parameters, to generate the CDF
  comparison plot. this should be cheap vs injrecov or even just recov, and will
  be useful to compare different whitening choices (and to justify the
  arbitrary search parameters ur currently using)

* be sure the two duplicates, 3832716 and 8167938, have both their periods
  treated (... or at least, be able to justify why they shouldnt)
