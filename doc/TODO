METHOD TODO:
* everything there.

PRODUCTION-LEVEL INJ/RECOV:

* store whatever stellar parameters you will need (e.g. peerless eqs 4-6. Need
stellar parameters, with better estimates than just asserting Rstar=1.5Rsun,
duty cycle estimate from time groups, eccentricity of orbit, etc. )

* to understand those parameters, consider the eventual inference you will be
making. it will be an (upper bound on an) occurrence rate over a volume, Γ_V vs
κ, a Fischer distribution parameter (since these two things are very
degenerate). 

* make sure SNR>3 cut makes it in.

* make sure exactly the same post-find_dips work is being on the injected LCs

* CANDIDATE SEARCH: review "maybes" too

* Make sure injrecov works with the recov-only update (i.e. test it & break it)

* make to account for SNR_rec_pf > 3 and multiple of P_rec_by_P_EB cuts in
evaluating completenss.  It shouldn't change things.

* which stars have known planet candidates already in our catalog (e.g., KIC
11013201 has real dips, and is also KOI 972. Possible delta Scuti 
oscillations, with the transiting planet. ?!?!. What does that mean about
evolutionary state?)

*Period finder:
    Assess for what fraction we need to revert to KEBC period.

* The argument against the statistical power of Armstrong's thesis work on
the shortest period binaries based on mutual inclination grounds was surprinsg
to Kratter (she expected that Welsh et al would have checked more closely).

Moreover, it can (& SHOULD) be investigated on simple grounds before diving
into the complicated work of developing a pipeline & computing its sensitivity.

These simple grounds are like: take two G stars. Put them on a 1 day orbit. You
get some range of inclinations on which they will be observed to eclipse.
Assume that the Kepler EBs are randomly drawn from this range of inclinations
(similar to Armstrong's work). 

Then assume coplanarity of the two orbital planes (for now). Put the planet at
the stability limit of the system (or near it). You can ignore precession (b/c
coplanar). Compute the fraction of such systems that then transit.

In particular, look at the sini's of things in KEBC v2 that were labelled
overcontact by human labellers (~427 objects). Maybe ~20-30% of them have
sini>0.8. So, 100 objects would be capable of transiting(? Maybe 50?).
Obviously far fewer if you throw out all morph>0.7 objects from your sample.
At 10% occ rate, you might have 10 transiting objects (order 1-10).
