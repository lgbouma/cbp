* reassess completeness. 

* make ur interp1d calls smarter (if possible)

* read WASP 33 Van Esse+ COROT paper. Î´ scuti w/ a transiting planet.
  > spatially-resolved light from transiting planet. Can you get e.g.,
  obliquity of star? (if you understand the pulsation dirns, you get a
  preferred dirn). Can u understand the pulsations better by getting spatially-
  resolved light?


##########
Possible improvements:

* which stars have known planet candidates already in our catalog (e.g., KIC
  11013201 has real dips, and is also KOI 972. Possible delta Scuti 
  oscillations, with the transiting planet. ?!?!. What does that mean about
  evolutionary state?)

* avoid fitting out subharmonics of planet transits!!
Example cases: 8122124. See 8122124_qnum9_inum2_sap.png
Possibilities: 
- model comparison?
- smart condition on really only searching for harmonics & subharmonics 
  of EB signal (i.e. look over some frequency comb)
- nb. this really should only be an issue w/ the shortest-period injected 
  planets

* review doc/discussion from 170308. consider integrating QATS (if we want 
  long-period, ED rather than just EC and EA sensitivity)

* Understand how DFM+ peerless implemented model comparison once you have nice
    transits. Implement it.

* implement Armstrong+ 2014, Sec 3.1. Box with local polynomial detrending
  (add it in astrobase, then call in find_dips)

----------

* How to fit out spots: e.g., with `george` (GP regression)?

Longer-term ideas:
*Detrend+normalize:
    Match the KEBC detrending? As-is, I think I'm leaving in trends that are
    too big.
*Period finder:
    Assess for what fraction we need to revert to KEBC period.

astrokep.find_lightcurve_gaps

* add "s2n_on_grass" (Petigura et al 2013) to cull out "significant" transits
-> can do this in post-processing, or (likely better) add direct to
astrobase. See FIXME below.

astrokep.stitch_lightcurve_gaps

astrokep.keplerflux_to_keplermag

ALSO:
 PyKE is also worth assessing: what detrending tricks does it use?
