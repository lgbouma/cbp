#TODO#
######

* debug why inum never goes above 2

* revise period bounds of iterative whitening to [0.05day, 5xP_EB]

* revise legendredeg(npts) function... maybe allow sharper even w/ fewer pts, as
  long as within "safe" period bounds (<5x P_EB).

* during iterative whiten, add f(t) filter with mid-level
  legseries filter, then subsequent subtraction for >~10day trend removal. 
  



* complete tests/assessment of how well iterative whitening looks like it's 
  working (see e.g., how far down you can push in the rms floor)
  (also note that many sharp features seem to fail)

* integrate iterative whitening into a recovery pipeline framework. reassess 
  completeness

* clear out the TODOs and FIXMEs from the iterative whitening implementation.


##########
Possible improvements:

* review doc/discussion from 170308. consider integrating QATS (if we want 
  long-period, ED rather than just EC and EA sensitivity)

* add "s2n_on_grass" (Petigura et al 2013) to cull out "significant" transits
-> can do this in post-processing, or (likely better) add direct to
astrobase. See FIXME below.


* Similarly, fine-tune the sigma clipping based on the actual RMS across a
    quarter. **If (once detrended+whitened) it's very small, we must allow
    bigger dips (w/out clipping them).**

* Understand how DFM+ peerless implemented model comparison once you have nice
    transits. Implement it.

* implement Armstrong+ 2014, Sec 3.1. Box with local polynomial detrending
  (add it in astrobase, then call in find_dips)

----------

* How to fit out spots: e.g., with `george` (GP regression)?

Longer-term ideas:
*Detrend+normalize:
    Match the KEBC detrending? As-is, I think I'm leaving in trends that are
    too big.
*Period finder:
    Assess for what fraction we need to revert to KEBC period.

astrokep.find_lightcurve_gaps

 ALSO:
lcmath.find_lc_timegroups -- basically an implementation of astrokep's
 find_lightcurve_gaps, already done.

astrokep.stitch_lightcurve_gaps

astrokep.keplerflux_to_keplermag

ALSO:
 PyKE is also worth assessing: what detrending tricks does it use?
