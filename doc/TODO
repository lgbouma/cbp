parse JNW discn from 170712.
parse Fei Dai conversation: phase-folding means only really are sensitive to
  contact binaries (b/c any further separation means too big TTVs for <~1hr
  duration transits which is what you get for P<20days)
  --> NEED TO ANSWER THIS EARLY OBVIOUS OBJECTION. EVEN IF IT SETS YOU BACK A
  MONTH.
  > means: look at maximal transit timing variation vs Rstar/a_bin


RERUN PRODUCTION-LEVEL RECOV:
X regenerate all dipsearchplots given fei's suggested improvements

X reinspect them all (~2hr tops)

X look more closely at the "failing" systems (b/c 1 of 10 is interesting,
  coincidence i think not)
  > 5/12 are "LC gave too many or not enough entries" -> something wrong with
  llc files
  > 2/12 are TypeError: 'float' object is not subscriptable
  > 1/12 ValueError: cannot convert float NaN to integer
  > 1/12 got fblserrr, touch'd a dipsearchplot placeholder (completed tho)
  > 3/12 finished, given more runtime

  none of the 4 that completed were interesting. leaves 8.
  > 5 are "LC gave too many or not enough entries" -> something wrong with
  llc files

  1_2856960.log, 2_3832716.log, 4_4150611.log, 5_7622486.log, 8_8167938.log

  AH. These are all KEBC entries with >=2 periods already in the catalog. Um we
  could still see how our iterative whitening does on these. Problem is that some
  have one detached entry, and one closer-binary entry. So reduction wouldn't
  work as well. Similar the period selection for whitening assumes a single
  binary period. Can go ahead and omit these (interesting!) objects

  > 2 are TypeError: 'float' object is not subscriptable
  > 1 ValueError: cannot convert float NaN to integer

  3 of 1515 failing is an acceptable error rate (though no fatal errors would
  be better).

X make sure they have realsearch working

X parse their pickles

----------
X crossmatch all ur lists (original realsearch dipsearcplot, Fei's parsing, my
  reparsing of the vet pickles plots)

X make final list of interesting objects
  -> it's 96 objects long.

BATCH VETTING
automate:
* identification of transit times, and timing variations



* exoplanet archive parsing
* imaging where available (CFOP)
* odd/even
* centroid shifts

Batch query ADS (by KIC number!), then:
* crosscheck candidate kicids with:
  * matson thesis
  * KOIs
  * pulsators
  * LAMOST catalog.
  
Ignore Tim Morton's FP probability cases.

Goal for candidate table:
* definitively rule out whatever you can. (and mark them as ruled out)
* keep the others as "plausible candidates"

* complete latter ~12 that take longer, on della since apparently adroit has
  like 20 functioning cores >_<

* every "maybe" or "dip" gets putative transits plotted individually

* which stars have known planet candidates already in our catalog (e.g., KIC
11013201 has real dips, and is also KOI 972. Possible delta Scuti 
oscillations, with the transiting planet. ?!?!. What does that mean about
evolutionary state?)

* review "maybes" too (from ur injections, these could be real)

* 12055014 -- plausible candidate (missed so far). There's obvious by-eye
periodic dips in 170510 flux vs time reduction

* should be able to identify KIC 2856960 events (Armstrong 2012's disc). (or at
  least know why they're not showing up)
  > first of all, they're one of the 12 that failed to run.
  > this probably means the other 12 are worth looking at somewhat more closely
  too... (after they run)




Monte Carlo experiments:
* note klagyvik's actual upper limit calculation (Poisson stats). might as well
  phrase yurs the same way (though it's... kind of BS)

* wrk out how ur gna sample stellar properties to be believable. might involve
  some library/ADS parsing.

  > e.g., q distribution from (Tokovinin 2000; Raghavan et al. 2010)

  SANITY CHECK: Matson 2016's true values.

* compute, and then plot upper limit on Γ vs R_p

* figure out how much stellar properties matter. Your conclusions should be
  robust against quite large shifts in the population.

* sample over some reasonable stellar mass distribution
  > e.g., draw primary mass from Chabrier (2003) IMF.
  > draw companion mass from Fig 30 of Moe & DiStefano 2017 -- accounts for the
  observational fact that wide solar-type MS binaries have mass ratios that are
  inconsistent with random pairings from a Chabrier IMF.

* sample over some reasonable stellar radius distribution
  > e.g., given a mass, and

* sample Rp radii from family of Kepler planets. (like, 12 delta functions)

* sample mutual inclinations δi from a Rayleigh distribution. (e.g., the posteriors of Li+ 2016)

for dilution D, also sample it. from:
* RoboAO papers: Nick Law.
* contact binary literature papers. (e.g., starting at Tokovinin's mass
  ratios). Look for luminosity ratios.

* try CKS:
  * if you assume all the light is from the primary star (crappy assumption),
    you, 
  -> use NASA exoplanet archive to cross-correlate those masses and radii with
    colors. Usual colors you care about: B-V, g-i

PAPER
* make a candidate table

* write up a bit less flippantly

* remove phase-fold snr vs period_cbp completenss map (it's messy)

* for the one candidate you'll show the in-transit displacement for, turn
row/col into RA/dec so that your plot can have RA/dec, and so that you can put
the star position down

* in injrecovresult_analysis, summarize_realsearch_result you want to be
including the top 5 BLS peaks for your cuts. matters for completeness!
(~40% vs ~50%)

#OPTIONAL TODO#

(aka: it would be surprising if this stuff happened)

* run thru whitening a few times w/ different parameters, to generate the CDF
  comparison plot. this should be cheap vs injrecov or even just recov, and will
  be useful to compare different whitening choices (and to justify the
  arbitrary search parameters ur currently using)

* be sure the two duplicates, 3832716 and 8167938, have both their periods
  treated (... or at least, be able to justify why they shouldnt)
