Identify highest significance dips in search:
##########

* in periodbase/kbls.py: add condition to ignore peaks that give BRIGHTENINGS
(rather than dimmings), i.e. get nbestpeaks that are POSITIVE.

* Sort discovered candidates by depth/RMS.

* after runs are complete, parse LOGS for LOGERRORs, e.g.,
      LOGERROR('ingbinind from eebls.f shorter than it should be.')
      LOGERROR('Hard-setting ingress and egress phases.')
  (that bug that I hard-coded a hacky-exception for, because I don't understand
  it)



* make injection actually optional in main

* run on actual KEBC stars, now that completeness is high enough.
  ->  _look through_ the ~1.5k search results, sorted per the above.

* refactor (e.g., on a new git branch) to take out pieces of code that are not
  and will not be used any more.

* how big & how fine of an injection grid do we need/want to answer the
  *statistical* questions (on occurrence rates)

* Um. The Jenkins matched-filter approach is VERY DIFFERENT on the surface from 
e.g., BLS. Are they equivalent? Which is better?

* why does that one KOI show up as a δ scuti? (was this a failure in the KEBC
  pipeline?). How many of these instances are there?

* read WASP 33 Van Esse+ COROT paper. δ scuti w/ a transiting planet.
  > spatially-resolved light from transiting planet. Can you get e.g.,
  obliquity of star? (if you understand the pulsation dirns, you get a
  preferred dirn). Can u understand the pulsations better by getting spatially-
  resolved light?

* bugfix:

Possible improvements:

* which stars have known planet candidates already in our catalog (e.g., KIC
  11013201 has real dips, and is also KOI 972. Possible delta Scuti 
  oscillations, with the transiting planet. ?!?!. What does that mean about
  evolutionary state?)

* make ur interp1d calls smarter (if possible)

* avoid fitting out subharmonics of planet transits!!
Example cases: 8122124. See 8122124_qnum9_inum2_sap.png
Possibilities: 
- model comparison?
- smart condition on really only searching for harmonics & subharmonics 
  of EB signal (i.e. look over some frequency comb)
- nb. this really should only be an issue w/ the shortest-period injected 
  planets

* review doc/discussion from 170308. consider integrating QATS (if we want 
  long-period, ED rather than just EC and EA sensitivity)

* Understand how DFM+ peerless implemented model comparison once you have nice
    transits. Implement it.

* implement Armstrong+ 2014, Sec 3.1. Box with local polynomial detrending
  (add it in astrobase, then call in find_dips)

----------

* How to fit out spots: e.g., with `george` (GP regression)?

Longer-term ideas:
*Detrend+normalize:
    Match the KEBC detrending? As-is, I think I'm leaving in trends that are
    too big.
*Period finder:
    Assess for what fraction we need to revert to KEBC period.

astrokep.find_lightcurve_gaps

* add "s2n_on_grass" (Petigura et al 2013) to cull out "significant" transits
-> can do this in post-processing, or (likely better) add direct to
astrobase. See FIXME below.

 ALSO:
astrokep.stitch_lightcurve_gaps

astrokep.keplerflux_to_keplermag

ALSO:
 PyKE is also worth assessing: what detrending tricks does it use?
