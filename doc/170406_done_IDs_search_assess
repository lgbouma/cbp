We have 1016 "contact EBs" in the Kepler sample (morph>0.6).

We've processed 818 of them:

  In [15]: done_ids = os.listdir('../data/injrecov_pkl/real/')

  In [16]: len(ids)
  Out[16]: 1016

  In [17]: len(done_ids)
  Out[17]: 1636

  In [18]: len(done_ids)/2
  Out[18]: 818.0

So it makes sense to keep running things on crispy. This will finish what we
can call a "nominal run". N.b. it's still sensible to complete the adroit move,
so that we can repeat it much faster (than the ~2 weeks this run took), and
also do inj/recov at reasonable pace.

--> Made "find_not_done_IDs.py" utility script to do this easily.

N.b. let's do 20 injection/recoveries per LC. This makes 20320 injection
recovery experiments, total.
