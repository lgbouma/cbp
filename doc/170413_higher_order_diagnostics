TODO:

* append contamination fraction to text files.
* make centroid motion plots

For every object:

* contamination fraction?

From https://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/PyKEprimerStitching.shtml:

"""
The FITS keyword FLFRCSAP contains the fraction of target flux falling within
the optimal aperture. The keyword CROWDSAP contains the ratio of target flux
relative to flux from all sources within the photometric aperture. Both
quantities are the average value over each quarter and are estimated using
point-spread function and spacecraft jitter models (Bryson et al. 2010)
combined with source characteristics found within the KIC (Brown et al. 2011).
The PDC time-series data archived within the FITS light curve files have both
of these corrections applied by default.
"""

-> These are stored in lcd[qnum]['varinfo']['aptgttotrat']
Close to 1 means not very contaminated. Close to 0 means quite contaminated.

* centroid offset during transit?
Likely either:

psf_centr1
psf_centr2
mom_centr1
mom_centr2

What are these? What's the difference?

Well, it looks like (N=2 quarters) psf_centr1 is typically nans, while
mom_centr1 has values. 

Talking w/ Kento:

Ya dude. Plotting out these centroids is a good idea.

From internet, yes MOM_CENTR1 and MOM_CENTR2 are the X and Y centroid over
time.

kepsff requires target position data on the CCD detector in order to correlate
spacecraft boresight motion with systematic signal within the flux time-series.
The typical Kepler/K2 light curve files have place-holders for two different
measures of source centroid: 1. center-of-light within the pixel aperture
(alternatively known as the zeroth-moment of the flux distribution over the
pixels). These two arrays, the X and Y centroid over time, are stored in FITS
columns MOM_CENTR1 and MOM_CENTR2. 2. The PSF-fitting method, the X and Y
locations of best-fit PSF models to the aperture pixels. These are rarely
available within archived Kepler data but can be stored in PSF_CENTR1 and
PSF_CENTR2. Both sets of centroids are provided in the output from kepextract,
where the moments data is generally preferred over the PSF data which derives
from the simplifying assumptions that sources are not confused and are
well-characterized by symmetric Gaussian profiles.
