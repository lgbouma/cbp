method todo:

* implement ad-hoc chopped up BLS (by quarter)

* add completeness map generation script (not just the pdf) to /paper/figures

* ditto cumulative whitening assessment (e.g., consider classic RMS vs apparent
mag, instead of just the RMS cumulative)

* be sure the two duplicates, 3832716 and 8167938, have both their periods
  treated (... or at least, be able to justify why they shouldnt)

* inject_transit_known_depth bug fix:
qinjsapflux = qsapflux + (qfluxtoinj-1.)*np.nanmedian(qsapflux)

pretty sure this is the wrong procedure. qsapflux is in ADU.
you want to... i THINK... just multiply qfluxtoinj (relative flux units) by
qsapflux. b/c if the entire star "gets brighter" (or really, there's some
instrumental brightening systematic)... i think you'd expect the transit depths
to scale commensurately.

--> this fixes the claim in your description of inj/recov that you're
multiplying in the signals.
(Following DFM peerless, p. 15: "the transit signal is computed and MULTIPLIED
into the PDC LC")

* improve write_search_result to write the correct parameters

* do the exercise of: "Can we rule out obvious astrophysical cases?"
  * assign each contact binary an orientation. (from isotropic cosi!)
  * assign a coplanar planet, exactly at the stability limit (or exactly at the
    median a_cbp/a_crit from Kepler CBPs, to make it slightly more realistic). 
  * for planet sizes to inject, estimate stellar size from period-color relations
    (very coarse)
  * get third light estimate from european groups' results
  * use the "vanilla" inj-recover rate to immediately get the probability of
    detecting these allowed hypotheses.

  If you can say "this case is definitely ruled out -- we know that these types
  of planets are not in the Kepler data", that is new knowledge.

* should be able to identify KIC 2856960 events (Armstrong 2012's disc)

* in find_dips: If Q0 RMS >> rest of quarters, just throw out Q0 when searching
  for dips.  (Otherwise the super-noisy bit dominates the search results).
  See: 11447953, 6471048

* rerun, given the new BLS search params (not much should change >_>)
-->e.g., BLS should have run out to longer periods (?). (Something for the
  rerun pre/during-paper writing).
