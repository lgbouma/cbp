method todo:

* rerun injection & recovery, given the new BLS search params (not much should
  change >_>)

  (Something for the rerun pre/during-paper writing).

* rerun main search

* run thru whitening a few times w/ different parameters. this should be cheap
  vs injrecov or even just recov, and will be useful to compare different
  whitening choices.

* implement chopped up BLS (by quarter, and quarter pairs)

* be sure the two duplicates, 3832716 and 8167938, have both their periods
  treated (... or at least, be able to justify why they shouldnt)

* do the exercise of: "Can we rule out obvious astrophysical cases?"
  * assign each contact binary an orientation. (from isotropic cosi!)
  * assign a coplanar planet, exactly at the stability limit (or exactly at the
    median a_cbp/a_crit from Kepler CBPs, to make it slightly more realistic). 
  * for planet sizes to inject, estimate stellar size from period-color relations
    (very coarse)
  * get third light estimate from european groups' results
  * use the "vanilla" inj-recover rate to immediately get the probability of
    detecting these allowed hypotheses.

  If you can say "this case is definitely ruled out -- we know that these types
  of planets are not in the Kepler data", that is new knowledge.

* should be able to identify KIC 2856960 events (Armstrong 2012's disc). (or at
  least know why they're not showing up)
