What cuts to make to produce an initial candidate list?
####################

Petigura et al. (2013, PNAS):

For actual candidates (not the injected ones), a mix of machine and manual
triage. For machine:
* Compute `s2n_on_grass`. Take the most significant period, P_max, and define
  `s2n_on_grass := SNR of P_max / (median of next five tallest peaks in
  [P_max/1.4, P_max*1.4]`.
* Require s2n_on_grass > 1.2 for transiting candidate event status (cuts
  ~60-70% of candidate events).
* Also require P_max>5 days

Citing Petigura et al. (2013) ApJ 770:69, he notes more aggressive automatic
cuts are feasible. However, they remove a handful of compelling candidates. You
can get higher completeness by relying more heavily on visual inspection.

Manual triage:
* Generates data validation summary plots, with diagnostics that are relevant
for mine too:
  * a `transit stack`: at identified transits
  * "single event statistic" vs phase 


TO MEASURE COMPLETENESS: (S7)
The injection/recovery framework was developed for P13 (the ApJ paper). More
details are there.

Injection procedure:
Generate 40,000 synthetic lightcurves according to the steps:
1. select a random star from sample
2. draw (P,Rp) from log-uniform distribns over 5-400d and 0.5-16Re
3. draw b and t_0 from uniform distrbns on 0-1
4. synthesize mandel-agol transit
5. inject the model into SAP flux of the star.

Then process it with all the same calibration, search, and data validation done
on the actual LCs.

**A synthetic light curve is "recovered" if the injected (P, t_0) agree with the
recovered (P,t_0) to 0.1 days)**

Compare to Foreman-Mackey et al. (2015)'s K2 procedure, described in their
table 1:
* q1 and q2 from q~U(0,1)
* P [days] from lnP ~ U(ln0.5, ln70)
* Reference transit time T_0 [days] from T_0 ~ U(0,P)
* Radius ratio Rp/Rstar, lnRp/Rstar ~ U(ln0.02,ln0.2)
* Impact parameter b~U(0,1)
* Eccentricity e~Beta(0.867,3.03)
* Argument of periapsis ω~U(-π,π)
