Quoting Armstrong et al. (2014):
```We elected to detrend the light curves from instrumental and sys-
tematic effects using covariance basis vectors. These were used over
the Presearch Data Conditioning (PDC) detrended data available as
the PDC data is not robust against long-duration events, as warned
in Fanelli et al. (2011), and the transits of CB planets may in theory
last for half the orbital period of the binary. While it would be ideal
to individually tune the detrending of all light curves, the sample
size made this impractical. Detrending was enacted using the PYKE
code (Still & Barclay 2012). At this stage, data with a non-zero
SAP_QUALITY flag was cut (see Fraquelli & Thompson 2012 for
full list of exclusions). Once detrended, quarter data were stitched
together through dividing by the median flux value of each quarter,
forming single light curves for each binary.```

Q1-Q12, took SAP from MAST. `orosz2012_kep47_dtr.png` is the thing to
emulate. Doing detrending separately by quarter, tune the "aggressiveness" for the
task. To model eclipses & transits, remove both instrumental trends and spot
modulations -- to do this, mask out eclipses & transits, a fit a high order
cubic spline to short segments whose end points are defined by gaps in the
data collection (due to monthly data downlink, rolls btwn Quarters, or spacecrft
safe modes). Normalize the segments to the spline fits, and reassemble the
segments.
