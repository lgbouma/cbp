Other than things already on the TODO:

inj/recov analysis & summarizing

Do it. (Already on immediate TODO)

##########
Better ways of zeroing out the EB signal (possibly to become more important):
##########
* Is Johan willing to share his code?
-> might just be a much better way of fitting out the full EB signal

* During phase-folded norm, dtr flux part, use something less sharp than n=80
legendre series depending on the morphology parameter.
(i.e. make the legendre series order a function of the morphology parameter)
-> fine-tune appropriate by using the 

* Print the morphology parameter on ur plots in the titles.

##########
Dipfinding: 
##########
* Another possible detection stat: also compute a fourier periodogram (e.g.,
LSP). The BIG NARROW peaks in the fourier periodogram should be spread out in
the BLS spectrum (these should be the EB periodicity hrmonics). 
The spread out peaks in the Fourier periodogram should be the narrow, box-like
planet peaks in the BLS spectrum

* Email Joshua Carter / is there a QATS implementation anywhere so that I don't
have to implement it?

* Update BLS dipfind to use vartools. Or something more sophisticated than Geza
Kovacs' implementation (e.g., vartools has the ability to change the acceptable
transit durations depending on the period)

* Why does 5615528 *change* (phase-folded) between quarters?

On possible secular flux vs time changes, e.g., b/c of star spots moving around
quasiperiodically:

* River plot!!!
* Another option: zoom in on the redtr flux vs time

Plot improvements:

show the phase-folded plots from phase -1 to 1. (the phase-folded norm, dtr
flux plots)

Talk w/ Ondrej:
* Any physical reason for the secular f(Ï†) change?
