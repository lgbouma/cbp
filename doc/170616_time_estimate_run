For injrecov:

742 done since 23:03 last night.

Means ~11 hours, or ~67 LCs done per hour.

Nominal detection efficiency assessment: efficiency of pipeline w/ new
additions not awesome either. Not clear why. (N.b. of those injected, have 324
recovered).

Independent (worse) estimate: ~225 done in ~3hr, 40min clock time. (counting
2-quarter case as less). Of order ~1 per minute (clock time). 24 hr = 1440
minutes per day.

==========
Around the clock means 1 week gives ~10k injrecov experiments.
