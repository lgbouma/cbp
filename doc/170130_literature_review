* Kepler binary system identification thru BEER. Find off-inclination systems. 
Has anyone done this? The idea is obv not new. But _literature search_.
Follow links thru Doyle paper. Possible authors: Mazeh, Armstrong, Triaud,
Fabrycky.
Mazeh like did on all the KOIs... but what about all 200k Kepler stars?

Martin, Triaud 10/2014:
Planets transiting non-eclipsing binaries

The majority of binary stars do not eclipse. Current searches for transiting
circumbinary planets concentrate on eclipsing binaries, and are therefore
restricted to a small fraction of potential hosts. We investigate the concept
of finding planets transiting non-eclipsing binaries, whose geometry would
require mutually inclined planes. Using an N-body code we explore how the
number and sequence of transits vary as functions of observing time and orbital
parameters. The concept is then generalised thanks to a suite of simulated
circumbinary systems. Binaries are constructed from radial-velocity surveys of
the solar neighbourhood. They are then populated with orbiting gas giants,
drawn from a range of distributions. The binary population is shown to be
compatible with the Kepler eclipsing binary catalogue, indicating that the
properties of binaries may be as universal as the initial mass function. These
synthetic systems produce transiting circumbinary planets occurring on both
eclipsing and non-eclipsing binaries. Simulated planets transiting eclipsing
binaries are compared with published Kepler detections. We find 1) that planets
transiting non-eclipsing binaries are probably present in the Kepler data; 2)
that observational biases alone cannot account for the observed over-density of
circumbinary planets near the stability limit, which implies a physical
pile-up; and 3) that the distributions of gas giants orbiting single and binary
stars are likely different. Estimating the frequency of circumbinary planets is
degenerate with the spread in mutual inclination. Only a minimum occurrence
rate can be produced, which we find to be compatible with 9%. Searching for
inclined circumbinary planets may significantly increase the population of
known objects and will test our conclusions. Their presence, or absence, will
reveal the true occurrence rate and help develop circumbinary planet formation
theories.

NOTES ON HOW TO FIND NON-ECLIPSING BINARIES / CBPs (from Martin & Triaud 2014):

Assume we want to identify the non-eclipsing EB first:

1) Reconnaissance spectra of the Kepler field should already have found many
double line binaries. (And likely threw them out for planet searches)

2) Ellipsoidal, reflection, & beaming effects are viable for P<~20d Kepler LCs.

Ignore the thought of trying to identify non-eclipsing EBs. 

3) Just search the Kepler data without a-priori binary knowledge. Focus on
algorithms for single transit/conjunction identification. [Via modifying DFM
long period search routine]. Perhaps insist on >=2 events to lower FP rate.
Insist on transits which give densities compatible w/ the stellar components.

4) Use Gaia data to find the non-eclipsing EBs. 

BEWARE:
* Applying a quasi-periodic transit signal criterion to find & confirm planets
"severely restricts the number of objects that can be find, and biases them
towards coplanarity"

Any search for non-eclipsing binaries w/ BEER-like capability would _certainly_
cite this paper. It has ~19 citations right now. Read thru them:

http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-ref_query?bibcode=2014A%26A...570A..91M&amp;refs=CITATIONS&amp;db_key=AST

Yeah NONE Of them are systematically identifying these non-eclipsing binaries.

BEER paper 1: Discovery of Kepler 76b, HJ w/ evidence of superrotation.
Faigler, Tal-Or, Mazeh, Latham, Buchhave.

Faigler+ (2012) RV confirmations of 7 non-eclipsing short-period binary systems
in the Kepler field.

* Cleaning and detrending is an essential first step.

* Applied BEER algorithm to ~42k stars, with K<13.7, and R_star_KIC < 4Rsun.

* Trick: divide up power spectrum into subranges to identify interesting
peaks (avoids obnoxious long period terms)

* This work: focused on sub stellar mass companion search. So temporarily set
aside the larger stellar mass companions

* Kepler 76 is an EB system. The BEER analysis did not mask out the transits or
occultations, instead identifying the outliers on the _unmasked_ data using "a
robust-fit function" (Holland & Welsch 1977).

* You can't see the modulation in the LC by eye. But phase-folded over 800 days
(n.b. dataset now 2x longer), you can get some interesting stuff.

* Spectroscopic follow-up was necessary for purpose of confirming that it 
wasn't a signal from stellar variability.

Faigler et al. (2012), ApJ
SEVEN NEW BINARIES DISCOVERED IN THE KEPLER LIGHT CURVES THROUGH THE BEER
METHOD CONFIRMED BY RADIAL-VELOCITY OBSERVATIONS

* Ran the BEER algorithm to 14,685 stars brighter than 13th mag,
w/ KIC Rstar<3Rsun.

* Calculating the BEER periodogram (Faigler & Mazeh 2011) with period range of 
0.5–20 days for each star.
 
* Identified the periodograms whose highest peak was at least three times 
higher than the next highest one. For these stars used the peak period 
to estimate the system secondary mass and radius, assuming the periodicity is 
induced by a secondary star. 

* Then selected 25 candidates with secondary mass smaller than 0.5 Msun and 
implied albedo smaller than 0.4, suggesting a significant probability for a 
low-mass companion.

* Followed up candidates w/ RV observations

* "In a forthcoming paper, we will report on the false alarm cases and 
analyze the false alarm frequency of our candidates."

* "Stellar modulations that now contribute to the FAP are not expected to be so
stable on timescales of years, whereas the three BEER effects are strictly
periodic and stable"

--> IDEA being to e.g., run BEER on different splits of the Kepler LCs. E.g.,
run it on first half, middle-half (1/4 to 3/4), last half. Derived periods
should not drastically differ.

Faigler et al. (2015), ApJ
BEER ANALYSIS OF KEPLER AND COROT LIGHT CURVES. IV. DISCOVERY OF FOUR NEW
LOW-MASS WHITE DWARF COMPANIONS IN THE KEPLER DATA.

* Adapted BEER search algorithm to identify compact object companions. Ran it
on ~40k stars with K<13.5mag.

This adaptation: assigns to each LC a likelihood that the star hosts a compact
companioon, and idetnfies the inferior conjunction from the amplitudes and
phases of the BEER modulation.

* To _MINIMIZE_ data preparation stages, reanalyzed the Kepler LCs post-BEER
run via:
1) remove data segments w/ instrumental artifacts (Faigler+ 2013)
2) subtract a third light constant from each quarter's data using its LC
crowding ratio (Jenkins+ 2010)
3) remove long-term trends by a _SINGLE_ simultaneous robust linear fit to the
data after masking out eclipses.
Simultaneous fit has 4 sets of functions:
  i) long-term cosine detrend fucntions of periods down to 2x P_orb
  ii) BEER cosine and sine functions ofthe first four orbital period harmonics
  iii) jump functions at predefined Kepler times (Faigler+ 2013)
  iv) high-frequency stellar activity sine and cosine funcitons.

Uhm... super-WASP data from 2004 to 2008 is PUBLIC. This might ~double the
number of detectable EBs w/ HAT LCs. (A related thing to search: are there
catalogs of EBs known from WASP?)

BEER PAPER 3: SPECTROSCOPIC CONFIRMATION OF SEVENTY NEW BEAMING BINARIES
DISCOVERED IN COROT LIGHT CURVES

* Zucker+ 2007: prediction that hundreds of non-eclipsing EBs will be
detectable thru beaming

** good method description (worth basing say, a Kepler analysis on)**

* This paper: RV confirmation of 70 beaming binaries found via BEER 

* 481 candidates for RV followup flagged from BEER search (visually).

* Periods ranging from 0.1-17 days. 0.5-87mmag in photometric amplitudes.

* Observed 281 of the 481 candidates w/ a multifiber spectrograph (AAOmega)
N.b. using a multifiber is a really good idea for quick observations (these
were all done over ~7 nights)

* For spectroscopic confirmation, did frequentist model comparison (computing
two Χ^2 statistics: constant RV star vs orbital solution)

* False Alarm Rates + Sensitivity (in COROT data):
a) Below 0.25Msun secondary Msini, pretty bad
b) FAP not a strong function of period, but OFC sensitivity is, especially w/
COROT LCs.

Conclude by noting:
*"Mering well-corrected large samples of COROT and Kepler beaming binaries with
equivalent EB samples, e.g., KEBC, might create large and well-defined samples
of short-P binaries, which might shed light on binary formation & evolution."

SHPORER: KEPLER HEARTBEAT STAR RV FOLLOWUP (2016) ApJ

Discovers that heartbeat stars TRACE the eccentricity-period envelope.

The idea then being that if you can measure the eccentricity & period of a
large sample of these as a function of _age_ (e.g., by searching thru open
clusters), you can learn something about tidal circularization timescales.

Okay. All of the above was more or less directed by the question of whether
BEER analysis on the whole Kepler dataset, and a subsequent search for CBPs
orbiting non-eclipsing binaries, would be worthwhile.

Looks like quite likely, yes. (No one has done it, and such CBPs are almost
certain to exist in the data given the rate about eclipsing binaries).

Consider, at the behest of GB, another three questions:

1) what papers are making the claim that the lack of CBPs about P<5d
binaries is significant?

Theory:
Formation mechanism of short-period binaries + CBP stability
* Martin, Mazeh, Fabrycky (2015) MNRAS
* Munoz & Lai (2015) PNAS
* Hamers et al. (2016) MNRAS.
(all three of above say: the KL cycles + TF forming the close binary make it
difficult for the CBP to be there.)

Transit probability:
* Li, Holman, Tao (2016). 
  Find that the transit probability of misaligned short-period EB systems is 
  similar to that of aligned long-period EB systems, if the planet is located 
  near the stability limit.
  If the planet survives during the short-period EB formation process, theory
  says it likely winds up on a mutually inclined orbit (which greatly diminishes
  probability of transit).

Actual experimental measurement of CBP occurrence rate:
* Armstrong, D.J. (2014) MNRAS "on the abundance of circumbinary planets"

On tertiary companions of close binaries:
(Timing:)
* Gies, D.R. et al. (2015) AJ: "Kepler Eclipsing Binaries with Stellar Companions"
* Borkovits et al. (2016) MNRAS "Comprehensive study of Kepler triples via
  eclipse timing"
(Spectroscopy:)
* Tokovinin et al. (2007): "Tertiary companions to close spectroscopic
  binaries".
  Fig 14. is a _killer_. P~2d, 95% chance there's a tertiary companion. P~4d,
  it's a 70% chance. """...essentially all very close SBs are members of
  higher-order systems. The KCTF is most likely responsible for shortening SB
  periods during their life on the Main Sequence."""




2) **how detailed was the associated data analysis?**
3) would it be worth the ~few months to catch up and say "yeah, it's legit"?
