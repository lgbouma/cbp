OVERVIEW

NASA's Kepler mission recorded the brightness of hundreds of thousands of stars
for four years with unprecented precision. Kepler's data are now public, and
most of its light curves have been scrutinized by the exoplanet community,
among others. 

In this project, we select a specific subset of stars whose intrinsic
variability has hindered planet searches: eclipsing binaries with periods less
than ~5 days. We remove the stellar signal, and perform a systematic search for
transiting, circumbinary, planets. To understand our search's completeness, we
must test our pipeline with fake signals, which we inject and then recover.

The motivations are A) to discover the planets and B) to improve understanding
of how common these planets must be (and in the event of no convincing
detections, to provide an upper bound to this occurrence rate).

PROGRAMMING APPROACH

Programming language: Python libraries wrapping over fortran and C for
numerically intensive subroutines.

Parallelization mechanism: MPI (embarassingly parallel part: each star in my
dataset does not care about the other stars).

Required libraries: Standard scientific python stack, + installation of third
party libraries managed via conda/pip. (+ Standard C & fortran compilers)

RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS:

Total cpu time: ~30k CPU hours. (~1 hour per injection/recovery experiment as
tested on adroit, ~20k experiments to fully sample our parameter space, then
10k extra hours for change).

Number of concurrent cpus: as many as possible (e.g., 1000, for my total job to
take of order 1 day). Given the Della job scheduling limits, this might merit
in-person discussion.

RAM per task: ~50-100Mb.

Total disk space: ~50Gb.
