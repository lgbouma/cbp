Lessons from looking at 500 dipsearchplots:

* Wonky edges of Kepler quarters mess with dipfinding routines

* A bunch of these LCs had spots(?) appear and disappear, e.g., over the course
  of a few quarters.
  I flagged these as "maybes", in case of "planet precesses in, transits,
  precesses out" type scenarios.
  What should I do with them?

* Even down in positions ~300-500 there was one dip that looked pretty
  reasonable, and a few maybes.

Bugs to fix:

* If Q0 RMS >> rest of quarters, just throw out Q0 when searching for dips.
  (Otherwise the super-noisy bit dominates the search results).

* Many dipsearchplot images (all flagged as "WTF") did not have images, likely
  b/c of some adroit fail. Make the images, and then look at them & label them.
