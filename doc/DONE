* use terra's GP regression for detrending, rather than legendre series sums.

> not terra's imple,entatio, but the scikit learn implementation seems pretty

* make completeness maps (vs Î´_inj, P_inj, P_EB, rms_biased)

> Done. We need ~4x better noise RMS across all LCs.
> Note (per discussion w/ Fei Dai) a better metric than RMS is CDPP over 6hrs.

> each window, compute variance. Then compute the mean of the variances".

* check normalization is being done thru *DIVISION* by mean (not subtraction),
b/c division preservers relative fluxes..

> Done

* Possible to high/loss pass filter at ~<2x EB period? (Read Feigelson text & see)

> Butterworth filters are the idea, and they ruin transits (smoothing is too
> powerful, timescales too close -- the sinc(f) of a FT'd box function does not

* Email Johan for his code -- more general fourier approach (more expensive
  too).

* iteratively whiten via either:
    1. if next bst period is a harmonic of original signal, subtract off new
    legendre fit
    2. scipy.signal: genereate filters based on Fourier representation of LC,
    including all the harmonics, and pass them thru
> barebones implementation done. 

* Iteratively whiten out more frequencies. (Say ~few more) (Nb. this depends on
  whether there are strong periodicities in current redtrended residuals, or
  whether the spot-movement is "pseudo-periodic")

* on iterwhiten plots: add ylabel including iternum (like what's already in fname)
  also show npts & legendredeg on phased fit.

* cut out data within "0.5d regions" of gaps (defined by
    >0.5day space btwn points)
  -> nb. lcmath.find_lc_timegroups(fsaptimes, mingap=mingap) is most relevant.
  -> implement as trim_near_gaps. 
  (nb. does not require "stitching" to get full LC... you can do just over 
  quarters still)

* revise period bounds of iterative whitening to [0.05day, 5xP_EB]

* debug why inum never goes above 2
  > bug: badly formed bracket -> a sqrt was trying to do a negative number and
  nanning

* during iterative whiten, add f(t) filter with mid-level legendre series fit
  (to time-groups), then subsequent subtraction for >~10day trend removal. 

* clear out the TODOs and FIXMEs from the iterative whitening implementation.
